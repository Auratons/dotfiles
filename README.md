# dotfiles
Dotfiles meant to be used in Z shell with oh-my-zsh and powerlevel10k theme.

For installation, you can use the following in your home directory:

curl https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Auratons/2db1bd338f79bc0e7edc26ee2cf07d48/raw/c29501937094a19fb4de6a8d07829990da56580c/dotfiles-install.sh | /bin/bash

As a font for your terminal emulator I advise to install, set and use patched 'Hack Regular Nerd Font Complete.ttf'
from https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/tree/master/patched-fonts/Hack/Regular/complete.

This repository was created by following a great article https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles,
for interaction with the local repository you must use, instead of 'git', alias called 'dotcfg' (take 
a look into .zshrc).
